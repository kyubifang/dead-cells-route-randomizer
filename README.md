This is a Dead Cells Route Randomizer, heavily inspired by the online Route Calculator, https://dead-cells-route-calculator.web.app/. As the web version is quite out of date, this program attempts to serve as an alternative until further notice.

Please note that this is all based off the data provided by the Dead Cells Official Wiki, https://deadcells.wiki.gg/.

While the data provided is based on the final v3.5 update, there may be inaccuracies present from v3.4 and future patches.

Note: This program assumes you have all the necessary keys, runes, and upgrades to reach each area. Please consult the legend at https://deadcells.wiki.gg/wiki/Biomes_map to determine what upgrades or paths must be used to unlock all of the biomes.

BEFORE DOWNLOADING:
  - First ensure that you have [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) and [JDK 16.0.1+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed on your computer.
  - It's highly advised to have a screen resolution of 1650 x 1050 at the minimum, scaled at 100%. (Will update code in the future to accomodate smaller resolutions and greater scalings)
  - Windows Defender may flag it as suspicious. Unfortunately I'm unsure how to workaround this.

TO USE:
  - Extract all files to a folder on your computer and run the .jar file.
  - Select how many boss stem cells you will be playing with.
    - If you selected 5 BSC, select if you wish to finish the game fighting the True Final Boss.
      - Choosing "Yes" will only generate routes that take you to the true final boss, while "Maybe" may take you there or to a different final boss, such as the Queen or Dracula, assuming their respective DLCs are purchased, otherwise it will only end with the HOTK.
  - If you have no idea which stat you wish to play this run, click the random stat box. This will randomly choose between Brutality, Tactics, or Survival for your run.
  - If you have purchased DLC, be sure to select which ones so that their respective biomes can be added to the randomized paths.
    - Note: There is no option to select the Rise of the Giant DLC. It is assumed you already downloaded it as it is both free to install and necessary to fight the true final boss.
  - Press the Randomize button to be given your routes, along with a basic explanation of what upgrades you should expect to find.
    - For cursed chests, the left cursed skull indicates how many guaranteed cursed chests you will find, while the right cursed skull is the likelihood you will find at least one more in your run.
  - If you would like a new route, simply click the Start Over button.

Border Colors:
  
  - Blue = base game

  - Purple = Queen and the Sea DLC
